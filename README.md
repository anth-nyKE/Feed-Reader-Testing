# Project Overview (Given by Udacity)

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.




## My Implementation

Udacity has already availed starter code for this project. Jasmine is the specified test suite.
The starter code has already specified the source code files in the script tags and has as well
incorporated the spec files, which are needed for testing


## How I did it

* 1 The starter code from Udacity has all the preliminaries in check. I dove straight to the 
*jasmine/spec/feedreader.js* file.

*2 The starter code has all the fields commented clearly, giving guidance on what test to be
implemented where.

* 3 Run the `index.html` file in any localhost server. I used a VSCode extension called 
*live server* by Ritwick Dey to run the file.

*4 Write up the tests using the `describe` and `it` Jasmine commands and resolve all errors
to ensure that the code works correctly.
